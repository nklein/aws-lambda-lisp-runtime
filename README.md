Current problem is that attempt to read request with Drakma results in a read error on the socket:

> Error: on #<BASIC-TCP-STREAM ISO-8859-1 (SOCKET/4) #x3020009D668D> : 
>        Operation not permitted (error #1) during read
> While executing: SOCKET-ERROR, in process toplevel(2).
> Type :POP to abort, :R for a list of available restarts.
> Type :? for other options.
